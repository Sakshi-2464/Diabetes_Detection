## Overview

The project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms for the early prediction of diabetes. Models were trained and tested on a real-world dataset and evaluated based on key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
