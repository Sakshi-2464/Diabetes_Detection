## Overview
The project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms for the early prediction of diabetes. Models were trained and tested on a real-world dataset and evaluated based on key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset includes health and lifestyle attributes for individuals, with the target variable `Diabetes_binary` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-diabetic).
**Features include:**
- `HighBP`, `HighChol`, `CholCheck` – Blood pressure/cholesterol info  
- `BMI`, `Smoker`, `HvyAlcoholConsump` – Health behavior indicators  
- `Stroke`, `HeartDiseaseorAttack`, `DiffWalk` – Medical history  
- `PhysActivity`, `Fruits`, `Veggies` – Lifestyle habits  
- `AnyHealthcare`, `NoDocbcCost` – Healthcare access  
- `GenHlth`, `MentHlth`, `PhysHlth` – Self-reported health  
- `Sex`, `Age`, `Education`, `Income` – Demographic data

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
